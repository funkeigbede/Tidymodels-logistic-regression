# Tidymodels-logistic-regression
This project predicts Heart attack with the Tidymodels package in R
Tidymodels id a frame work of package for data modelling and machine learning.
Dataset was modelled for logistic regression, Todymodels can also be used tomodel dataset for other machine learning algorithms like RandoM Forest etc
Our model has an accuracy of 0.989, sensitity of 0.98, precision of 0.959, but a specificity of 0.2(because our dataset is imbalanced, ensure dataset is balanced before pass ing the dataset through the tidymodels).
